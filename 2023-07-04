Bash:

1. Finished up v1.0 of the cell backup script (although some latest functionality is not tested). Total time needed: 13 days (so approximately 13 hours).

Other:

1. Researched a bit about the VPS platform, now that the cell backup script is done, thinking about getting a domain and creating my website. EDIT: It's very probably going to be Hetzner.

Total time: 60 min
