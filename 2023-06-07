Python:

1. Learned what's the get() method. https://stackoverflow.com/a/2068377

Development:

1. Played with Git aliases a bit, found out they don't work like I thought, implemented some Bash aliases for Git instead.
2. Explored what's a factory method. Probably will explore deeper tomorrow. Also, what's an interface? RealPython.com
